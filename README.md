🛡️ CYBER SECURITY INTERNSHIP TASK — FULL DESCRIPTION
This task introduces you to network scanning and enumeration, which are essential skills for cyber security analysts and penetration testers. You will use Kali Linux tools like Nmap and optionally Wireshark to analyze a local network and identify open ports, services, and potential risks.


Task -1:
1.Install Nmap from official website.
2.Find your local IP range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
3.Run: nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 to perform TCP SYN scan.
4.Note down IP addresses and open ports found.
5.Optionally analyze packet capture with Wireshark.
6.Research common services running on those ports.
7.Identify potential security risks from open ports.
8.Save scan results as a text or HTML file. give the decription

🔍 Scanning
Performed TCP SYN scan on local network using Nmap
Executed network scan on subnet 192.168.40.0/24
Identified active hosts and open ports with Nmap

🧠 Service Research
Mapped open ports to corresponding services (SSH, HTTP, SMB, etc.)
Added analysis of common ports and associated security risks

📊 Packet Analysis (Wireshark)
Captured and analyzed SYN packets using Wireshark
Applied filters to observe Nmap behavior during scan

🛡️ Risk Assessment
Documented potential vulnerabilities of discovered services

Provided security recommendations based on open ports

💾 Saving & Reporting
Saved scan results as text and HTML files
Generated scan.html from XML using xsltproc
Uploaded final scan report and analysis

📝 Final Summary or Report
Added internship task summary and theory explanation
Compiled complete step-by-step documentation of the Nmap scanning task
